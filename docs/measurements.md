# Analyzer operational measurements

These measurements were taken on Apple Silicon on 2026-08-11 and 2026-08-12
against the production Bundle Server, using read-only collection and local fact
writes. They are workload observations, not portable guarantees.

## Bundle retention behavior

The configured retention contract is eight days. Deterministic boundary checks
cover the Worker cutoff (`8 × 86,400,000 ms`) and the Analyzer default (eight
UTC dates).

The server returns HTTP 410 with `window_expired` for hours outside retention
and HTTP 200 with an empty `items` array for a retained hour with no Bundles.
The source adapter preserves this distinction; an expired day is abandoned,
while a retained zero-Bundle hour can be committed.

## Collection throughput

A busy Source Hour contains roughly 2,400 Bundles. Initial conservative
collection took five to six minutes per busy hour. Because the workload is
latency-bound, increasing download concurrency from 4 to 8 approximately
halved collection time. Concurrency 64 produced no observed server-side
pushback when the HTTP keepalive pool was sized to match.

Transient collection failures use bounded jittered backoff. A valid
`Retry-After` response can extend the next delay up to 60 seconds. Once a fatal
Bundle failure is observed, queued downloads that have not started are
cancelled; already-running requests are allowed to finish before the Source
Hour fails without a commit.

## Local fact storage

Busy hours produce roughly 17–22 MiB of Parquet, dominated by Battle Cards.
Five sealed Source Days occupied about 1.9 GiB.

## Analysis resources

Analysis of five Source Days containing 2.79 million Battles took about four
seconds and stayed below 1 GiB RSS. The seven-day offline fixture remains below
the 8 GiB build limit.

Projection flushes fixed 50,000-row Arrow batches. A 2,500-Bundle synthetic
hour with 1.13 million Battle Card rows peaked 159 MiB above its fresh-process
baseline and produced 23 Parquet row groups. A production busy-hour heal with
734,544 rows peaked at 0.65 GiB for the whole process, below the 1 GiB hourly
ingest limit.

After Run performance instrumentation was added, the current 2,500-Bundle,
250,000-card acceptance fixture completed in 3.10 seconds, peaked about 148 MiB
above its fresh-process baseline, and kept whole-process RSS near 241 MiB.

## Consumer snapshot size

The two current snapshot sizes have not yet been measured in production.

## Performance evidence

Each Run Report records low-cardinality collection totals: listing pages and
requests, listing/download retries, download attempts and bytes, and p50/p95
attempt latency. Run timings separate source indexing, download waiting,
projection, Parquet writing, fact finalization, and each product's build, local
save, and publication stages. This is diagnostic evidence rather than a
portable service-level guarantee.
